		<p>This assignment is a web version of 
		<a href="http://science.kennesaw.edu/~bsetzer/4520fa13/nanoc/output/assignments/2/">Assignment #2</a>.
		Create a web page with a form that will let the user enter parameters for a loan:
		annual interest rate as a percentage;
		number of months in the term of the loan;
		amount of the loan.
		Create a Python script that will, when the user submits the form, creat a web page with 
		an amortization table for the loan with a layout similar to that in
		<a href="http://science.kennesaw.edu/~bsetzer/4520fa13/nanoc/output/assignments/2/">Assignment #2</a>.
		The response page should also display the parameters entered by the user.</p>

		<p>Use the stylesheet <a href="http://science.kennesaw.edu/~bsetzer/4520fa13/nanoc/output/assignments/supplement/style1-assignment05.css">style1-assignment05.css</a> to style
		both the user entry page and the response page.</p>

		<p>Your submission should consist of two files: an HTML page and a Python script.
		These will be run in a web server running under Linux Mint.
		The stylesheet will be accessible as 
		<code>/style1-assignment05.css</code>
		and the script will be accessible as
		<code>/cgi-bin/name-of-script.py</code>.
		You may name the files any reasonable names, the user entry form should, of course, reference the
		actual name you give the script. </p>
