7. Table 5.4 shows the CPU bursts and arrival times for five processes; assume that the time units are in microseconds. Use
this data to construct a Gantt chart and calculate the various performance metrics for SPN sheduling.


8. Use the data in T 5.4 to construct a Gantt chart and calculate the various performance metrics for RR scheduling. 50


10. Calculate the relevant performance metrics for FCFS sheduling. Assume process P6 arrives at time 200 with a 
CPU burst of 65 microseconds

11. "  " for SPN scheduling. Assume the same as above.


13. same as 10 and 11 but with SRT scheduling.
